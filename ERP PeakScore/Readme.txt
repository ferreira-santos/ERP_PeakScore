README

ERP PeakScore 1.0 is a small program designed to extract
amplitude and latency measures from event-related potential data
exported from EEGLAB in ASCII format.

The output of ERP PeakScore is a comma-separated value (CSV) file
with the results of the peak scoring procedure. This CSV file is
in ASCII format and can be edited with any text editor or, perhaps
more conveniently, with a spreadsheet software.

Unfortunately, detailed documentation is not available for the 
current version. Please refer to the help tooltips on the program
window, and to the "Instructions.txt" and "Citation.txt" files
(accessible from the program's help menu) for additional information.

For updates, please check the software section of the website of 
the Laboratory of Neuropsychophysiology (also accessible from the 
program's help menu):
